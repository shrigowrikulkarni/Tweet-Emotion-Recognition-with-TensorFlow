# Tweet Emotion Recognition: Natural Language Processing with TensorFlow


## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that our model depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Behaviour
In this project, we are going to create a recurrent neural network or `RNN` and train it on a tweet emotion dataset ([Tweet Emotion Dataset](https://github.com/dair-ai/emotion_dataset)) to learn to recognize emotions in tweets. The dataset has thousands of tweets each classified in one of 6 emotions. This is a multiclass classification problem in the natural language processing domain. We will be using `TensorFlow` as our machine learning framework.

## Steps
The notebook of model project is divided on parts that are :
1. Setup and Imports
2. Importing Data
3. Tokenizer
4. Padding and Truncating Sequences
5. Preparing Labels
6. Creating and Training RNN Model
7. Model Evaluation
